The core idea behind Upspeak is to build a natural discussion and knowledge
sharing system that has these four focus areas:

1. enable discussions based on context (or, maintain context in all conversations),
2. seamlessly blend synchronous and asynchronous communication modes,
3. create a distraction-free experience,
4. design to be inclusive from the ground up

Upspeak aims to be a virtual discussion system optimized for human interaction
by overcoming social, cultural, language, discipline, technology or physical
barriers. Conversations here are treated as dynamic, contextual entities that
are discoverable at atomic level.
