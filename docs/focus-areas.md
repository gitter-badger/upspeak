# Focus areas

## Maintain context of all discussions

Create and retain relations between discussions. Given any point in a conversation, show how it is connected to the rest of the system. Make it easy to access those relations.

## Context graph

Group conversations in threads, rooms and workspaces. Make every entity discoverable and linkable. Entities can be cross-linked with a simple syntax. Visualize the connectedness of conversation. Switch between thread view, graph view, and chat scroll.

## Reduce information overload

Build UX to achieve balance between information overload and information poverty. Make people feel calm and informed. Understand how [information overload](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/23544/) snowballs in times of public panic. Help people get access to information, minux the anxiety.

## Real-time with offline capability

The system updates in real-time when connected to the internet. States persist automatically. No user action is needed. Writing and limited access should be possible while offline. Data is synced when online.

## Multi-mode communication

Allow text, audio and video communications. Fall back to asynchronous communication modes when real-time communication fails.

## Interoperability

A comprehensive HTTP API. Allow data import and export. Integrate with existing tools and services wherever possible. Allow combining data from multiple sources.

## Ease of use

Provide clean UX with clean, distraction-free, accessibility-friendly UIs. Distraction-free mode is the default. Only show elements relevant to context. Easily switch between views and threads.

## Zero-config setup

The system should be usable right away after installation.

## Decentralised

No single entity should control the data. Data storage should be decentralised and distributed wherever possible. Built on [Matrix](https://matrix.org).
