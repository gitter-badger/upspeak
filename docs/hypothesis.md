# Hypothesis

Individuals interact with other individuals over time and in different contexts, and generate information through discussion. In the process, they make use of multiple props and actions to convey their intent and thoughts.

Like the physical world, an individual can watch, participate in, or start a discussion. Depending on their location and the time, the individual will be able to learn a scoped context of the discussion. This is equivalent to asking another individual nearby, "what's going on here?"

The more they are curious the more they get to know how the discussion has reached this far. They can ask other individuals, "Give me the gist".

Unlike the physical world, the individual can then choose to follow their curiosity, and visit all connected discussions in all of recorded space-time. They may not want all the details all the time, and so they can ask for a summary, with a higher level view of the key events in the discussions. They may then choose to focus on specific parts of the discussion, and land in the scoped context of that event in the discussion.

In the flow of a discussion, an individual, or a group of individuals, can have related thoughts that they consider meaningful, but which may end up sidetracking the original discussion. Such related discussions often end up sprouting new thoughts and ideas, and deserve a conversation of their own.

An individual may also notice that a similar discussion has happened earlier, and they may wish to reference the other discussion in the present one. In some cases, they may see it fit to carry on the discussion in the previous group. These lead to multiple pathways that event narratives can take.

In reality, event narratives form complexly interwoven structures. An individual can ask to know the different pathways that have lead to their current vantage point, the different pathways that lead away from there, and the related discussions that sparked from there.
