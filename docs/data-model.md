## Data model

### Event

Events are nodes that form the unit of discussion in Upspeak.

- Who said it?
- When did they say it?
- Has this already occurred, or will this occur at a later time?
- Where did they say it?
- What did they say?
- How can I interpret and understand what they said?
- Were they responding to something? If yes, what?
- Where did this discussion begin?
- Can others respond to this? If not, what should they take away from this?

### Context

Context graph ties together Nodes in a meaningful way. Contexts are the edges between event nodes. Think of them as natural conversation threads. The context changes based on the current point of view of the reader.
